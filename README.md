# 🗺️ Travel Albums

> **TL;DR:** A local-first React gallery for exploring a Google Takeout-style photo archive. It indexes photo metadata, generates thumbnails, and turns a large personal collection into filterable galleries, timelines, places, trips, albums, and maps.

Travel Albums is a Vite/React interface for exploring a Google Takeout-style photo archive.

## ✨ What it can do

[![Travel Albums](/readme/features.png)](https://github.com/rand0mC0d3r/trip-gallery)

- 🖼️ Browse all indexed photos in grid, row, scroller, day, or negative-conversion views.
- 🧭 Group collections into dashboard sections such as albums, countries, cities, people/pets, trips, timeline, tags, and “now and then”.
- 📍 Use EXIF/GPS metadata for location-aware views and nearby-place suggestions.
- 🔎 Filter, sort, search, pin, select, favorite, tag, ignore, or mark photos private.
- ⌨️ Navigate and select photos with keyboard shortcuts.
- 🗂️ Explore indexed thumbnails and normalized metadata from Takeout sidecar JSON files.
- 🎞️ Inspect EXIF details, maps, charts, collages, and image-negative conversion tools and adjustments tools.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher (a current LTS release is recommended).
- npm


### Install and run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite development client at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🧑‍💻 Everyday use

| Goal | Where to start |
| --- | --- |
| Browse everything | Open **All Photos** |
| Discover groups | Open the **Dashboard** and select a populated section |
| Change presentation | Use the gallery-type control to switch grid, rows, scroller, per-day, or negative modes |
| Compare or curate | Turn on selection mode, select photos, then apply favorite/private/ignore/tag actions |
| Navigate efficiently | Use `←` / `→` to move the preview; in selection mode, use `Enter` to toggle the current photo |
| Refresh source data | Reload the indexed data available to the client |

The UI uses hash routing, so it can be hosted from a relative path and its views can be deep-linked with URLs such as `#/allPhotos` and `#/selectedPhotos/:type_name/:id`.

## 🧩 Architecture and patterns

### Client

- **React 19 + TypeScript + Vite** power the client; `@/` aliases `src/`.
- **Material UI** and Emotion provide the component system and theme-aware styling.
- **React Router** maps a JSON route catalog to pages, redirects, and menu items.
- **React Query** wraps client data fetching, while focused React context stores hold gallery state.
- **i18next** supplies localization wiring.

`AppProviders` composes settings, theme, notifications, filters, selection, labels, favorites, privacy, and derived gallery-data providers around the route tree. This keeps page components focused on rendering and interaction.

### Data model

The client’s core `GalleryPhoto` model (`src/lib/galleryData.ts`) includes:

```text
id, albumName, title, batch, takenAt, takenAtTs, width,
latitude?, longitude?, people[], imageUrl, sourceUrl, tiny,
likes, views, description, social[]
```

Section hooks transform these records into UI-ready groups. A section contains a type, title, and sets of photos; the dashboard and selected routes consume those derived collections rather than reimplementing grouping logic.

## 🎛️ Extending the interface

### Add a route or page

1. Create a page under `src/pages/`.
2. Register its component key in `src/routes.ts`.
3. Add a matching entry in `src/data/routes.json`.
4. Control visibility, menu inclusion, label, icon, and order from the route JSON.

### Add a derived gallery section

Place reusable grouping logic in `src/hooks/sections/`. Compose existing data-transform hooks and return stable, UI-ready section data. The section provider makes the result available to the dashboard, navigation, and selected-gallery routes.

### Add a visualization

The gallery visualization selector chooses a renderer based on the persisted `albumType` setting. Keep a new page-local renderer adjacent to its consuming page in a feature-specific components folder; place shared UI in `src/components/`. Use the existing renderer contracts that accept `GalleryPhoto[]`.

### Add state or remote data

- Keep reusable state logic in `src/hooks/`.
- Use a focused context store when state is shared across unrelated views.
- Put request wrappers in `src/hooks/remote/` and expose loading, error, data, and refresh/cancellation behavior.
- Keep source modules out of `src/gallery`, which is reserved for volatile gallery data/assets.

## ⚡ Performance notes

Trip Gallery is designed for photo libraries that do not fit comfortably in a single DOM render:

- `react-virtuoso` backs grid and row gallery renderers to virtualize long lists.
- Background workers perform expensive grouping and filtering for sections.
- Derived hooks favor memoized, stable data transformations to limit rerenders.
- Vite ignores archive, thumbnail, and sprite folders during development watch; `npm run analyze` emits `dist/stats.json` for bundle inspection.

## 🛠️ Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the Vite client |
| `npm run build` | Create a production client build |
| `npm run preview` | Build and preview the client |

## ✅ Contribution guidelines

- Keep components small and place reusable components in `src/components/`.
- Use one React component per file.
- Prefer Material UI component props, theme tokens, and scoped `sx` styling over raw inline styles.
- Extract reusable React behavior into `src/hooks/`; name hooks with `use…`.
- Keep transforms deterministic and memoize expensive derived data.
- If `src/gallery` is present in a working copy, treat it as volatile gallery data/assets and do not add source modules there.
- Do not commit personal paths, archives, thumbnails, generated metadata, or credentials.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before opening a pull request.

## 📦 Build and packaging

The standard build produces static client assets in `dist/` with relative asset paths, which supports desktop/embedded packaging.
